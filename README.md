# Etch A Sketch
This is my Etch A Sketch project as part of The Odin Project Curriculum.

The goal was to create a grid that can be drawn on by a user, like an Etch A
Sketch. The grid size can be changed dynamically within the canvas. The content
can be cleared at will.

You can play with it [here](https://newmanem23.github.io/etch-a-sketch/).
